# completion-treesitter
Treesitter source and more for [completion-nvim](https://github.com/haorenW1025/completion-nvim).

This is a basic completion source based on the treesitter api of neovim.

# Goals
The aim of the plugin is mainly to fiddle a bit with treesitter, and a nice way is completion, but there is many things we can do with it.

There is still some goals for the plugin:
  - As hackable as possible
  - As fast as possible

# TODO
That's the ideas I had in mind at start, but feel free to suggest anything !

  - [x] Completion
    - [x] Basic
    - [x] Suggest only symbol in current scope
    - [ ] Intelligent suggestions (based on types for examples)
    - [ ] Include file handling (`:h include-search`)
  - [ ] Text objects
